Employee Analysis using SQL
Overview
This project involves analyzing fictional employee data from multiple CSV files. An Entity Relationship Diagram was created using QuickDBD and files were imported into a SQL Database.  SQL queries were used to extract and analyze the data.

Data Source
The data used for this analysis is fictional was generated by Mockaroo, LLCLinks to an external site., (2022). Realistic Data Generator.
